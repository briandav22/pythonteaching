# First things first. Notice the # sign at the very left of this python file. That means that this is strictly a comment and it won't run as part of your program. 

# Comments are super useful when writing code as a way to remind you why you did something, or to provide others some details about what a specific peice of code actually does. 

# 'commenting out code' is also helpful when debugging parts of your projects, if you highlight a portion of your code in the text editor and hit 'apple symbol + /' it will comment out that block for you. 


#this below code would run 
print('hi')


#This code would not run. 
#print('hi')
