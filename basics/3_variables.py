#Variables can be used to store more then just strings. 

#you can store intergers

my_int = 1 

#floating points 

my_float = 1.50 

#lists / dicts, or really anything you want. 

#practical use cases for variales are typically going to be for things you are using over and over again. For example, say you have some password you are going to be feeding into a function over and over again. We will get to functions later, but here is an example

password_variable = 'my_secure_password'

#examples using a variable: 
    #function_using_password(password_variable)
    #different_function_using_password(password_variable)

#examples using a string: 
    #function_using_password('my_secure_password')
    #different_function_using_password('my_secure_password')


#now say if you wanted the password, you would only have to change it in one place, instead of in each function call.
