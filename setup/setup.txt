The first thing we will want to do is make sure you have a text editor and the ability to run python programs. 

For this I suggest Microsoft Visual Studio Code. It's the most popular text editor for coding, and it's what I use which will make it easier to pass on the knowledge. 

After that we will make sure python3 is install on your MAC and we can then run some sample code.
